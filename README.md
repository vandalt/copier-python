# Simple Python Package copier template

Mostly based on https://github.com/dfm/copier-simple-python. Writing step-by-step to make sure I understand what it does.

## Things missing for v1
- [X] pre-commit
- [X] docs
- [X] Run on simple existing project
- [X] Test with readthedocs
- [X] Tests for parent repo

## Things to add eventually
- [ ] Github workflows
  - [ ] Tests
  - [ ] pre-commit autoupdate
  - [ ] code coverage?
- [ ] Github workflows for parent repo
- [ ] Automatically generating gitignore from script/github gitignores?
- [ ] Automatically setting the year in Jinja
- [ ] Automatically fill in dependencies from an input list?
- [ ] Automatically update pre-commit?
- [ ] Automatically generating license files if `license` command is available?
- [ ] C/C++ support (including `.gitignore`, pre-commit, packaging)
- [ ] Update minimum/maximum Python version automatically based on system version or some online reference (not sure that's a good idea)/
- [ ] Add dependencies
